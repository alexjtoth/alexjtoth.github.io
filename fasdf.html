	<title>About Me/Resume</title>
</head>
<body>

	<p> I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying to get a Bachelors of Science in Information Science, with a minor in Political Science. I have passions for design, statistics, sports, politics, Spanish, and data analysis. I am a fan of the Golden State Warriors, Manchester United, and the Buffs!<p> 
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Colorado_Buffaloes_logo.svg/1200px-Colorado_Buffaloes_logo.svg.png" alt="buffs" class="center" >

	<p> I have many years of professional paid and unpaid work experience. I have worked in the fields of youth development, technology privacy policy, guest services and hospitality, and youth sporting events. This experience has translated to productive work and knowledge that can be applied to new career fields. I am studying to enter into the field of data analytics and want more opportunities exposing myself to this interest. I have also gained a passion to learn Spanish. I believe this will help me in formal and informal workplaces when translation is needed. I have also committed much of my time serving my local communities. I have logged over hundreds of hours of community service since high school. I have worked with impoverished youth in Ecuador and SF Bay Area, taught mathematics and history to elementary students, and with the homeless in San Jose and Boulder.<p>
