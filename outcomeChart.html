<ul>
  <li>NA = Nothing</li>
  <li>Warning = Got off with a warning</li>
  <li>Citation = Was cited</li>
  <li>Arrest = Was arrested</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is the result of every traffic stop in this dataset. The outcome can be considered as arrests made and not made, but stops also have other results. We see that the majority of stops result in nothing, 'NA'. Citations follows as the next most prominent followed by arrests and then warnings. It is really interesting to see how stops are really broken down. Only a small percentage of stops result in arrests, but a lot more stops result in citations and warnings. There were a total of 6,365 stops made in this dataset. If we add up all the actions that are not 'NA' we see that 2,777 instances resulted in the officer having to warn, cite, or arrest the person. This is 43.6% of all stops. 43.6% of all stops result in some sort of action. I started looking into which precincts all these actions happened in. This would be the next step from here. To filter the data even more. It would be interesting to get a better idea of which precincts have more arrests, citations, warnings, or nothing.
