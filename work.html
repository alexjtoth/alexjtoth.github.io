	<p> I have completed numerous projects and works. I have included some of the projects raning from data analysis, to technical comunication, and some Spanish. Hope you like what you see! <p>
	
	<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
	<h3> The 3pt Explosion in the NBA </h3>
    <p>This was a project completed for my Computational Reasoning 2 Course (INFO 2201). The project description was, tell something interesting from the data. I decided to look at NBA data from mainly the 2018-19 Season and from the previous 20 years. I wanted to find patterns in the data. I found that 3-point shooting has increased dramatically in the last couple years. This project forced me to scrape data of the web and deeply analyze it. I have attached a pdf of my full project where I delved into the 3-point revolution.

	<h2>Technical Communication</h2>
	<p> In my Technical Communication Course (WRTG 3035), me and my group of three were tasked with drafting and finalizing a professional parent manual for Forest Time Kindergarten in Perrysburg, OH. <p>

 	<p> This process took 2 months of trial and error. We intend for this to be an easy to read manual that will greatly help confused parents at Forest Time Kindergarten. This group project helped a small business and improved my technical writing skills. </p>

	<h2>Spanish</h2>
	<h3> El Ritmo Cultural </h3>
	
	<p> This group project was apart of my Spanish in 21st Century Media class. We were tasked with creating a podcast in Spanish. My group members and I wanted to create a cultural experience for all Spanish speakers. Our topics in our initial podcast were Mate consumption in Argentina, Balearic Music in Spain, and updates for the largest Spanish soccer team, Barcelona.<p>

    	<p>In INFO 1111, my final project was to collect information and tell a story. My group decided to look at student finances at CU Boulder. We conducted dozens of interviews to students of all socio-economic backgrounds. We also conducted a large scale survey to gather information. We were tasked with visualizing and telling a story with the data. We realized that "$20 dollars is a lot to the average student". During the process, we needed to take into account for scholarships, financial aid, employment, in-state, out-of-state, savings, debt, loans, and many more variables. Overall, this project highlighted the financial responsibility that comes with being a college student and the difficulty of gathering information to answer a specific research question.
