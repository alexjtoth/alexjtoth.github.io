<h1>Redesign</h1>
<p> For my homepage, I decided to use a carousel to display multiple images. I used a carousel that fades into the next image. This way I was able to create a smooth transition between images. I also added the block of text to the middle of the carousel and created a border with a low opacity. This meant the text and image would look better and more clean. I also added a layout of buttons across the top of the page. This was implemented so it would be easier to navigte the site. A link to the homepage is right below.

</p>
<p> For my next page, I split the page into containers. This was for the layout of the page because I wanted to format it more like a resume. I was able to put my work experience down easily, but it took much more time to add the skills and awards section. I also added the buttons across the top of this one too.

<a href="newAboutMe.html">About Me/Resume</a> 
</p>
<p> On my work page, I added an accordion to display my projects. This is a bootstrap component from class, but I felt it was the best way to represent my work in a minimal amount of space. I also added the buttons across the top of this page too.
<br>
<a href="work.html">Work</a> 
</p>
<p> I did not customize this page as much. The only bootstrap component is the buttons across the top.
