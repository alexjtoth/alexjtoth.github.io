		I initially started this assignment by looking at all the different bootstrap features. I didn't look at other websites, until I fully read the assignment. I did some digging and found a couple good websites that caught my eye. The first website is <a href="https://harrisonjansma.com">this</a> one. Harrison is a coder and analyst. He links to a lot of projects that I have taken under at some point. His site is clean, easy to navigate, and is completely coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

		The next site I want to talk about is <a href="https://davidventuri.com">this</a> one. I liked the feature where the designer puts a large background image. Every tab is clean and the colors match very well. The first page is relatively simple and that is common with mine. Overall, these two sites helped give me inspiration for this assignment and are strong examples to use.
