	<p class="Avatar" > One of my favorite TV shows is Avatar the Last Airbender. The show, “consists of sixty-one episodes. Each season of the series is known as a "book", in which each episode is referred to as a "chapter". Each book takes its name from one of the elements Aang must master: Water, Earth, and Fire” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">(Wikipedia.org)</a>. Aang is the Avatar, the only one that can learn all four elements. He must do this to fight against the tyrannical takeover by the Fire Nation. They are trying to take over the world. That is why the show is a great representation of imperialism. Simply, one nation decides to start taking over others and assimilate them to the new regime. The increase in popularity and ratings of the show increase throughout the seasons. This shows us that conflict gives the viewer more interest in the plot and grabs our attention. Yes, characters develop throughout the seasons, but we are introduced to new protagonists and antagonists all the time. This adds to the total conflict and builds tension for the last bits of fighting. </p>

	<p class="Avatar" > We can look at the TV show as a case study on,“the micro-level impact of war and how the expansionist attempts of one aggressive nation can shatter individuals’ lives and communities. Using violence and trauma as its conduits, “Avatar” conveys a starkly anti-colonial message that forewarns the dangers of imperialism” <a href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/06/16/avatar-the-last-airbender-a-critique-of-colonialism/">(Vera, 2020)</a>. The overarching plot of the show is the rise of the Fire Nation and their ambitions for world control. There are some similarities with symbols, art, colors, and architecture that mimics a Japanese Empire during World War 2. Aang and his friends must navigate a world controlled by the Fire Nation and have to restore peace among the nations. The show highlights the atrocities and oppressive legacies of imperialist nations and actions. </p>

	<p class="Avatar" > The show thrives on conflict, but the main character is a peace loving, vegan monk. That is why the show constantly adds characters throughout Aang’s journey to create conflict that must be resolved.  The show introduces, “a tyrannical ruler and generated vehement opposition towards this ruler, but in the end, the series still focused on the importance of peace, redemption, and respect for all forms of life” <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/1/avatar-the-last-airbender-blows-spongebob-out-of-the-water/">(Kelly, 2020)</a>. We are watching the show for the conflict, but to see how that conflict is resolved. If an episode ends with conflict, we will be intrigued to watch the next one to see what happens to resolve this. That is why the build up for the final season is so huge. It is the overarching conflict that the entire show builds up for, amongst all the smaller conflicts. <p> 

	<p class="Avatar" > When looking at the ratings for a TV show, there are so many things that contribute to this score. In general, the rating will reflect the audience’s interest and attention to the plot. This TV show increases in rating as the seasons progress. We see in the visualization below that each season gets progressively higher in rating. Everyone has their own opinion about the show and individual episodes. But there is a progression that should not be ignored here. It is rare to see shows get better over time. This attests to the show’s greatness, as the conflict in the show builds up. <p>

	<p class="Avatar" > The dataset I used for this graphic can be found at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ekrembayar/avatar-the-last-air-bender">Kaggle Link</a>. I aggregated the IMDb ratings across each book of episodes. They progressively got higher ratings. The show also has a 100% rating on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/avatar_the_last_airbender">Rotten Tomatoes.</a> The show has a mean IMDb rating of <b>8.63377 per episode.</b> <p> 

	<p class="Avatar" > The television series Avatar the Last Airbender is an animated series that addresses the destructive nature of imperialism while a group of friends navigate life on the road to eventually challenge the imperialists. The show has many hidden historical references to imperialist regimes in the past. The show lives off conflict between the nations. If there was peace, there would not be a need for a show. The world lives in harmony and there is no reason why things are out of balance. This is one of my favorite shows and I hope you get a chance to watch it if you have not. <p>
