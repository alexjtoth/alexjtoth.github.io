	<p>The past weeks have highlighted the volatility of the stock market. But on top of that, the rise of Gamestop (GME) stock price raises important questions about our financial institutions. In quick terms, a hedge fund had a large short on Gamestop and other companies stock, betting the price would go down. Users on a subreddit titled, /r/WallStreetBets noticed this and started buying shares to increase the price of those shares. This inflated the price many times over and because of the rapid, abnormal increase, it caused confusion across the markets. As Information Science students, we look at an event like this and think about the data and policies/solutions that will be produced as a result. What kind of data can we get from something like this? What should we do with this data? And what will be the reaction to this event in light of all this potential data? Below I have added a visualization of the price of GME to show how rapid this happened. </p>
