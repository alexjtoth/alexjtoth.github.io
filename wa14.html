<h1 id="firstHeader">Weekly Assignment #14</h1>

<p>
	In my <a href="wa4.html">week #4 assignment</a>, I wrote about Avatar the Last Airbender. My essay argued about the increase in popularity in the show as the seasons continued. This was because of the conflict amongst characters, nations, and plot. We see that the IMDb rating increases as the seasons continue. Episodes within the seasons also increase in rating towards the end. I will write about 3 ways I can present this work to 3 different audiences using different methods.  
</p>

<p>
	I could use a jupyter notebook to display how I was able to aggregate the data. This took a couple steps. This is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ekrembayar/avatar-the-last-air-bender">link</a> to the dataset I worked with. The data needs to be run and put into the notebook. We can use our skills to filter the data and then portray it in a visualization. A notebook would work well for a more data driven audience. They would want access to the behind the scenes and see how the chart was created. They may also find inspiration in the available code to extend on it or find something similar. 
</p>

<p>
	The next way I could portray this data about Avatar would be through a Reveal.js slidedeck. This could be used for an audience that does not know the show well. I could provide each plot context and argument about the show into individual slides. We know how to format and edit slides to an extent now. We also know how to host data on slides. The data could be interactive and may give extra motivation for the audience to do more research on the topic.
</p>

<p>
	The last way I could present this information is through a webpage like I already have. This is accessible via the web page link and that can be found on my github page. This may also cater to those more data-driven minded viewers. They may know how to access the links, notebooks, and scripts. The webpage needs to be updated and look more professional, but you get the point that it is geared more towards those that may also view a notebook for the data.
