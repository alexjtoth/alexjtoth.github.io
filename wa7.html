</p> The first base chart. I have only changed the data.

<a href="wa7version2.html">Version 2</a> 
<p> I modified the first chart into a line plot. I also decided to make the borders larger so it was easier to spot each individual point. As well, I stretched the scale of the chart by making the top of the y axis reach 50.

<p> I put the legend below the chart near the names of the colors. I also changed the font of the legend. I also took the background colors out so under the chart is not represented by the same color of one point. I added events: ['click'] under options. This makes it so you have to click the point on the graph so you can check out the total. I increased the size of the font for the legend as well and added a title at the top.
