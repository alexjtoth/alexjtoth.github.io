<p>The past weeks have highlighted the volatility of the stock market. But on top of that, the rise of Gamestop (GME) stock price raises important questions about our financial institutions. In quick terms, a hedge fund had a large short on Gamestop and other companies stock, betting the price would go down. Users on a subreddit titled, /r/WallStreetBets noticed this and started buying shares to increase the price of those shares. This inflated the price many times over and because of the rapid, abnormal increase, it caused confusion across the markets. As Information Science students, we look at an event like this and think about the data and policies/solutions that will be produced as a result. What kind of data can we get from something like this? What should we do with this data? And what will be the reaction to this event in light of all this potential data? </p>

<p>When we think about the kind of data we can get from an event like this, we have to start with the rise in prices on the stock market. It was reported that many of these shares being bought were from third party trading applications such as Robinhood. Robinhood has rapidly increased its user base in light of the rise of stocks such as Gamestop. We willingly use these third party applications to make trades. We tie financial accounts, along with our personal information to these companies. Among these users, it has been revealed that over 60% of Robinhood users had money in Gamestop stock. Robinhood is able to track what their users are buying and selling. They can moderate the trends within the app, and these trends actually showed up in the stock market. The massive increases by day traders has flipped these shares on their heads. We can see a real time manipulation of the market by looking at the buying trends of a single app.  We can also infer that the users buying stocks in the last couple weeks are people that usually make smaller trades. This type of data we can get about the millions of investors, along with the trends of the market, we can clearly see who is being affected.</p>

</p> What should be done with the data? Now that the market is returning back to normal, we can look back and see what can be done. All the signs point to the subreddit as the epicenter of this market activity. Thousands of Reddit users are a part of a platform within a platform. Reddit hosts many subreddits for particular interests and discussions. /r/WallStreetBets is where the ideas to “short squeeze” Gamestop stock started. This is where users could discuss what they were going to do. It was out in the open, but many did not take notice until the market data started going up. Robinhood was then another platform that these Reddits could use to carry out their plan. Robinhood saw a flooding of users and transactions that has created a more regulatory market. Robinhood saw this data and decided to stop trading on those shares for some time. The collective action by Redditors caused a market frenzy that has forever changed the way the market will be viewed.   </p>

</p> The reaction from Wall Street and third party applications has not been on par with the majority of the public. We see differences in reactions from certain parties. Robinhood users exclaim that this is illegal. Which it most likely is. The SEC has mentioned their initial investigations into this matter. The outrage has been sparked as we see that Wall Street gets bailed out again. When everyday people want to dip their toes into the market and this mass coordination takes place, Wall Street says no. It reinforces the notions that Wall Street is only for and by the elite. As Information Scientists, we want to see these different reactions form possible policies, regulations, or new products. Will Robinhood have to change their business model, as they may not want to support users doing what just happened? Will there be government policy to restrict the amount of shares bought on these apps? Will there be policy debates over the legality of everything that has happened?  </p>

</p> This event has highlighted the volatility of the stock market and questioned the ethics involved with trading. It is not illegal to do what the Redditors did and to short certain shares. But this whole situation is seen by many as market manipulation in both directions. Although I wish I got in on this to make a quick buck and it is fun to see Wall Street squirm, we must think of the precedents this will set. All the information we have about this is available as a result of the rapid innovation of technology. Information is spread so fast across millions to billions of sites. The platforms we have created for discussion and community have started dictating the markets. I do not know where I stand on this, but we can clearly see how the financial system in this country is manipulated. We use information to manipulate information. </p>
